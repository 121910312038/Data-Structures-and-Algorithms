# Data Structures and Algorithms
This respository is a collection of readable and clean implementation of data structures and algorithms in JAVA. This is a work in progress, so some algorithms may not be included. The optimised solution to some of the popular problems from Leetcode, Geeksforgeeks, Interviewbit etc. are also added. Feel free to suggest any algorithms that you'd like to see implemented in the future. If you have any questions, requests, or find any error in the provided solutions, please don't hesitate to contact me (my contact information is at the bottom of this file). If you found this repository helpful, I'd love to know :)
